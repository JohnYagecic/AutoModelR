This project is intended to be the replacement for the Hydrodynamic Model automation files written by John Yagecic for the Delaware River Basin Commission and documented at:

http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jawr.12185/abstract

The original code was written in Excel VBA.  This project seeks to update the code into R.  This update is being performed for several reasons, including:
- Concern that Microsoft will end support for Excel VBA at some point;
- To refine the code and eliminate "klugey" fixes that have accumulated over the years;
- To allow more widespread sharing of the code via github (and hopefully cultivate opportunities for collaboration on automating other models); and
- To continue to refine and develop my own R programming skill set.

I welcome opportunities for collaboration.  Please feel free to contact me.
